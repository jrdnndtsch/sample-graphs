## Getting Started
make sure that you have `node http-sever` installed. If not you can find it [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server). Once you have that installed make sure you are in the root directory of the project and run `http-server`. This will start up a local server (likely on port 8080). Head to http://localhost:[port] and view the project.
